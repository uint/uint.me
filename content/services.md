Some services I offer are

- custom software development (Rust, dev tooling, dApps, smart contracts),
- consulting,
- code reviews,
- training,
- architecting smart-contract-based solutions.

My rate is around 50 EUR/h. I'm open to fixed price contracts as well.

Full-time employment is possible, but please note I'd be looking to shift my
career to a more managerial track rather than stick with hands-on software
development. I only accept take-home assignments that take 2 hours or less.

Feel free to [send me an e-mail](mailto:website@uint.me) describing what you're
looking for and let's see if I can help!
