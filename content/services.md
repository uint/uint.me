Some services I offer are

- custom software development (Rust, dev tooling, dApps, smart contracts),
- consulting,
- code reviews,
- training,
- architecting smart-contract-based solutions.

My rate is 80 EUR/h. I'm open to fixed price contracts as well.

Services are offered on a freelance basis, with a defined scope, deadline and
maintenance period (if applicable) written into the agreement. Let's meet each
other with clear expectations and upfront communication.

Feel free to [send me an e-mail](mailto:website@uint.me) describing what you're
looking for and let's see if I can help!
