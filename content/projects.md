### serbia
[serbia](https://github.com/uint/serbia) is an attribute macro that helps work around
[Serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)'s limitation with regards to (de)serializing
arrays of length larger than 32.

### groupsync
[groupsync](https://github.com/jamf/groupsync) is a tool for syncing
LDAP group membership info with GitHub teams. [My former company](https://www.jamf.com/)
was awesome enough that they let me open-source it. It was also a way for me
to learn some [Go](https://golang.org/).
