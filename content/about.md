I'm a techy thing-doer. I do things. IT things. These things often involve
programming and automation.

I love [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/). If you have any Rust things to do,
do [contact me](mailto:uint@lavabit.com).

```rs
enum Answer {
    Yes,
    Maybe,
}

fn should_uint_be_contacted(things_to_do: &[&str]) -> Answer {
    match things_to_do.iter()
        .find(|s| s.contains("rust")){
            Some(_) => Answer::Yes,
            _       => Answer::Maybe,
        }
}
```

I currently live in Poland, but I love moving about. In fact, I prefer it.
