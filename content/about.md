I love [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/). If you have any Rusty things to do,
do [contact me](mailto:uint@lavabit.com). I'm looking for clients, commissions,
contracts, part-time work, and so forth.

I'm also looking to break into decentralized tech. I follow it keenly
and understand blockchain fundamentals. Learning Substrate currently!

```rs
enum Answer {
    Yes,
    Maybe,
}

fn should_uint_be_contacted(things_to_do: &[&str]) -> Answer {
    match things_to_do.iter().find(|s| s.contains("rust")) {
        Some(_) => Answer::Yes,
        _ => Answer::Maybe,
    }
}
```
