I'm Tomasz Kurcz, an independent software developer. I often go by _uint_ on the
web.

I do [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), blockchain stuff, smart contracts, dev
tooling, and am currently [teaching myself](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) to
design and implement programming languages. It's a blast!

This website is my business card and portfolio.
